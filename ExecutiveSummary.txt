Assignment Overview(250 words) - purpose and scope of the assignment

The purpose of the second assignment is to incorporate RPC, multi-threading, and mutual exclusion into our server/client programs previously written in assignment 1. Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) enable the client to perform actions as though the necessary code was part of the client. This allows the client to use the functions located on the server and manipulate data on the server without requiring the client to understand the server's network details. In addition to incorporating an RPC structure, we have also included multithreading on the server side. This addition allows the server to handle multiple requests from multiple different clients involving the same data (in our case, the key value store). Previously, our server could only handle 1 client request at a time and therefore only 1 request would be manipulating the key value store. Now that multiple threads may be trying to access the same data, we had to include mutual exclusion to our code. We initialize a lock which is required for any thread to perform a put or delete function since these actions would manipulate the shared key value store.

While there are many multithreading implementation options, this group chose to implement thread pools. This choice was made in light of ease of implementation as well as the frequency of their use in real world applications. A key short-coming of our implementation is not requiring a lock for any get request. This leaves us open to the scenario where a get returns an invalid response to the corresponding client because a put or delete on the same data has not completed. However, requiring a lock for the get request would cause a slow down for all get requests to prevent against this scenario and therefore our group decided against requiring a lock for get requests.
